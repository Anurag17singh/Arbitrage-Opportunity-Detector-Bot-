# Arbitrage-Opportunity-Detector-Bot
A bot in Rust that detects potential arbitrage opportunities on the Polygon network.
It monitors two decentralized exchanges (DEXes) — QuickSwap and SushiSwap — and checks whether a profitable price difference exists for a given token pair (e.g., WETH/USDC).
It is implemented in Rust using the ethers-rs library and designed to run against a live Polygon RPC endpoint.
